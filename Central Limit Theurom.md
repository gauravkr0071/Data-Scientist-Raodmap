### __Central Limit Theurom__
- Definition \
  The central limit theorem (CLT) states that the distribution of sample means approximates a normal distribution as the sample size gets larger, regardless of the population's distribution.
- Sample sizes equal to or greater than 30 are often considered sufficient for the CLT to hold.
- A key aspect of CLT is that the average of the sample means and standard deviations will equal the population mean and standard deviation.
- A sufficiently large sample size can predict the characteristics of a population more accurately. 
### __Assumptions Behind the Central Limit Theorem__
- The data must follow the randomization condition. It must be sampled randomly
- Samples should be independent of each other. One sample should not influence the other samples
- Sample size should be not more than 10% of the population when sampling is done without replacement
- The sample size should be sufficiently large. Now, how we will figure out how large this size should be? Well, it depends on the population. When the population is skewed or asymmetric, the sample size should be large. If the population is symmetric, then we can draw small samples as well

General Rule : a sample size of 30 is considered sufficient when the population is symmetric. \
<code> <i>The Central Limit Theorem states that the sampling distribution of the sample means approaches a normal distribution as the sample size gets larger â€” no matter what the shape of the population distribution. This fact holds especially true for sample sizes over 30.</i>  </code>
