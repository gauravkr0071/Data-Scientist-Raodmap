# __Linear Regression__

### Assumptions 
- __Linearity :__ There should be a __linear and additive relationship__ between dependent (response) variable and independent (predictor) variable(s). A linear relationship suggests that a change in response Y due to one unit change in X¹ is constant, regardless of the value of X¹. An additive relationship suggests that the effect of X¹ on Y is independent of other variables.
- There should be no correlation between the residual (error) terms. Absence of this phenomenon is known as Autocorrelation.
- The independent variables should not be correlated. Absence of this phenomenon is known as multicollinearity.
- The error terms must have constant variance. This phenomenon is known as homoscedasticity. The presence of non-constant variance is referred to heteroscedasticity. 
- The error terms must be normally distributed.
