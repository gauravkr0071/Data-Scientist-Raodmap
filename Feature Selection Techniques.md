Recursive Feature Elimination, or RFE for short, is a popular feature selection algorithm.

RFE is popular because it is easy to configure and use and because it is effective at selecting those features (columns) in a training dataset that are more or most relevant in predicting the target variable.

There are two important configuration options when using RFE: the choice in the number of features to select and the choice of the algorithm used to help choose features. Both of these hyperparameters can be explored, although the performance of the method is not strongly dependent on these hyperparameters being configured well.

In this tutorial, you will discover how to use Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) for feature selection in Python.
