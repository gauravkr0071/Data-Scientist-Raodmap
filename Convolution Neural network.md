# __Convolution Neural Network__

- [CNN are shift/translation invariant due to pooling layer, and shift equivariant due to convolution layer ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4Quhf9NhMY&t=933s)
- CNN are not inherently rotation invariant, but we can make it rotation invariant by feeding data by image agumentation/or rotated images, or [using filters of different sizes](https://miguel-data-sc.github.io/2017-11-23-second/)
- CNN are not scale invariant, but can be made scale invariant by zooming in image or zooming out/ data agumentation
